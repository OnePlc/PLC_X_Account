# Dynamic Fields

As with every oneplace-skeleton based Module, you have dynamic fields
for onePlace Account. So you can fully customize your experience with
Accounts, by defining own Tabs, Fields and Permissions.

Read more about dynamic fields in the [oneplace-skeleton documentation](https://docs.1plc.ch/oneplace-skeleton/dynamic-fields/)
